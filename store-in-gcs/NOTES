CLOUD FUNCTION (2nd gen) CHANGES

PERMISSIONS

https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/iam/roles
https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/authenticating#auth-func-to-func

Hmm, permission denied from pubsub trigger. I *think* trigger runs as default compute engine account 267654136269-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

which has
 roles/editor

maybe it needs

roles/run.invoker

Though the docs say this has the desired effect. Not sure if it was needed.

gcloud --project=pennantchase-256 functions add-invoker-policy-binding new_games_to_db       --region="us-west1"       --member="serviceAccount:267654136269-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com"


Answer from SO:

"Check if your Pub/Sub service account has the iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" .. and you can do it directly by trying to create a new trigger !!!
